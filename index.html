  <div class="custom_design">
    <p>The Mughal Empire, Mogul or Moghul Empire, was an early-modern empire in South Asia. For some two centuries, the
    empire stretched from the outer fringes of the Indus basin in the west, northern ,in the northwest, and  Kashmir in the north, to the highlands of present-day Assam and Bangladesh in the east, and the uplands of the
    Deccan plateau in south India.  The Mughal empire is conventionally said to have been founded in 1526 by Babur, a
    warrior chieftain from what today is Uzbekistan, who employed aid from the neighboring Safavid- and Ottoman
    empires, to defeat the Sultan of Delhi, Ibrahim Lodhi, in the First Battle of Panipat, and to sweep down the plains
    of    Upper    India.  </p>

    in the Indian subcontinent. The Mughal Empire was founded by Babur, a Central Asian ruler who was descended from
    the Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur (the founder of the Timurid Empire) on his father's side, and from Genghis Khan on
    his mother's side. Ousted from his ancestral domains in Central Asia, Babur turned to India to satisfy his
    ambitions. He established himself in Kabul and then pushed steadily southward into India from Afghanistan
    through the Khyber Pass. Babur's forces occupied much of northern India after his victory at Panipat in
    1526. The preoccupation with wars and military campaigns, however, did not allow the new emperor to consolidate
    the gains he had made in India.

        northeast</span> </div>Pakistan, Northern India, and Bangladesh from 1530–1540 and again from
    1555–1556. Like his father, Babur, he lost his kingdom early but regained it with the aid of the Safavid dynasty of
    Persia, with additional territory. At the time of his death in 1556, the Mughal Empire spanned almost one million
    square kilometres. In December 1530, Humayun succeeded his father to the throne of Delhi as ruler of the Mughal
    territories in the Indian subcontinent. Humayun was an inexperienced ruler when he came to power, at the age of 22.
    His half-brother
    Kamran Mirza inherited Kabul and Kandahar, the northernmost parts of their father's empire. Kamran was to become a
    bitter rival of Humayun. </p>

    wife Hamida Banu Begum, a Persian princess. Akbar succeeded to the throne under a regent, Bairam Khan, who
    helped consolidate the Mughal Empire in India. Through warfare and diplomacy, Akbar was able to extend the empire in
    all directions and controlled almost the entire Indian subcontinent north of the Godavari River.[citation needed] He
    created a new ruling elite loyal to him, implemented a modern administration, and encouraged cultural developments.
    He increased trade with European trading companies. India developed a strong and stable economy, leading to
    commercial expansion and economic development.[citation needed] Akbar allowed freedom of religion at his court, and
    attempted to resolve socio-political and cultural differences in his empire by establishing a new religion,
    Din-i-Ilahi, with strong characteristics of a ruler cult. He left his son an internally stable state, which was
    in the midst of its golden age, but before long signs of political weakness would emerge.
